  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>Hi there! I am Kayla, someone who genuinely enjoys spending hours in front of a computer—solving problems, building projects, and turning ideas into reality through code. My passion for coding started with curiosity and quickly turned into something much more meaningful. Whether it’s developing a small tool to automate a task or creating a full-fledged web application, coding gives me a sense of excitement, creativity, and control that’s hard to find anywhere else.</p>
  <p>What I love most about coding is how it combines logic and creativity. On one hand, it’s about solving puzzles and thinking critically—writing efficient algorithms, debugging tricky issues, and optimizing performance. On the other hand, coding is also an incredibly creative outlet. It lets me design user experiences, experiment with different technologies, and build things from scratch that didn’t exist before. That balance of precision and imagination is what keeps me hooked.</p>
  <p>Over time, I’ve explored a variety of programming languages and technologies. From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development to Python, Java, and C++ for backend and systems-level programming, I’ve enjoyed learning how different tools are suited for different tasks. I particularly enjoy working on web development and automation projects, but I'm always curious to explore new areas—whether it's game development, mobile apps, or artificial intelligence.</p>
  <p>One of the best parts of coding, for me, is the endless opportunity to learn. There’s always a new framework, language, or concept to dive into. It’s a field that never stands still, and that’s what makes it so exciting. I enjoy reading tech blogs, watching tutorials, contributing to open-source projects, and experimenting with code in my free time. I also like helping others learn to code, whether it's through mentoring, writing guides, or just answering questions online.</p>
  <p>Beyond the screen, what drives me is the idea that code has the power to make a real impact. With just a few lines, we can build something that helps people, entertains them, or solves a problem they’ve had for years. That feeling of making something useful and meaningful—something that others can interact with—is incredibly rewarding.</p>
  <p>Whether I’m building a fun side project, solving a challenge on a coding platform, or collaborating on something bigger, I’m always happy when I’m coding. It’s more than just a skill or a job to me—it’s a way of thinking, creating, and constantly improving. And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
